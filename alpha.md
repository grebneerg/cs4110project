Over the past few weeks, we have been working on both planning and implementing our final project for CS 4110. Our goal for the final project of this course is to create an interpreter for our so-far-unnamed functional programming language. Our interpreter will include basic type checking, custom data types, and similar features to other functional languages such as OCaml and Haskell. One of our big goals is to create a module system that allows for a standard library implemented in the language. We would like things like strings and lists, for example, to be custom data structures instead of language primitives.

As we conclude the Alpha milestone of our final project, we have created the initial lexer, parser, AST, and interpreter for our language. These four components will constantly be updated as we continue to add new features, such as modules and a standard library, to our language during the next two milestones. During this phase of the project, we spent a great deal of time simply discussing implementation strategies that would potentially help us with future stages of the project. However, given the fact that this milestone encompasses only a small part of our final system, there is a possibility that we may choose to include or remove features in the future.

For the next phase of our final project, we want to finish the implementation of the core features of our language and start the implementation of pattern matching and modules.
